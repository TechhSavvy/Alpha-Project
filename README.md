# Alpha Project

This project is a combination of all my projects repositories accumulated together, the Alpha of them all.

## Introduction

The more I learn, the bigger the "Alpha Project" will get. Also my github repos.

API, databases, framwork, authentication, a all in one.

Each asspect of the "Alpha Project" will have its own repo somewhere on my github with a decisive note folder, stating how, why I'm taking that approach, etc.  

## Purpose

It'll all boil down to problem solving, yea right, like when doesn't is. I'm hoping to not only see my github repositoires grow, but actually create some powerful tools why im at it.

## Deployment

Do to me building this with angular framework, i'm pretty sure you should also be using Angular/cli.
