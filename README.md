# Alpha Project

This project is a combination of all my projects repositories accumulated together, the Alpha of them all.

## Introduction

The more I learn, the bigger the "Alpha Project" will get. Also my github repositories, lol.

Think of turning 10, 20, even 30 small project concepts such as API, databases, framwork, authentication, all into one project.  

## Purpose

It'll all boil down to problem solving, yea right, like when doesn't is. I'm hoping to not only see my github repositoires grow, but actually create some powerful tools why im at it.

## Deployment

Do to me building this with angular framework, i'm pretty sure you should also be using Angular/cli.
